OWL Full is a very powerful language but it is undecidable, which makes complete reasoning support impossible. To regain computational efficiency, OWL DL (Description Logic) was introduced as a sublanguage of OWL Full. OWL DL restricts the way OWL and RDF constructors can be used, ensuring that the language corresponds to a well-studied description logic and enables efficient reasoning support. However, this restriction means that full compatibility with RDF is lost and an RDF document will need to be extended or restricted to be a legal OWL DL document. OWL Lite is a further restriction of OWL DL and is easier for users to grasp and for tool builders to implement. However, this comes at the cost of reduced expressivity, as OWL Lite excludes language constructors such as enumerated classes, disjointness statements, and arbitrary cardinality.

OWL is built on RDF and RDF Schema and uses RDFâ€™s XML syntax as its primary syntax. However, this syntax can be difficult to read, so other syntax forms have been defined for OWL. These include an XML-based syntax that does not follow RDF conventions and is easier for humans to read, an abstract syntax used in the language specification document that is more compact and readable, and a graphical syntax based on UML conventions which is widely used and familiar to many people.


OWL (Web Ontology Language) is a language for expressing knowledge about the world in the form of ontologies. An ontology is a collection of concepts and relationships that describe a domain. OWL ontologies are stored as RDF documents and use RDF's XML syntax. However, there are other syntax forms available such as an XML-based syntax, an abstract syntax, and a graphical syntax based on UML. The root element of an OWL ontology is an rdf:RDF element that specifies a number of namespaces. The ontology may start with an owl:Ontology element that contains comments, version control, and inclusion of other ontologies. The only assertion in owl:Ontology that affects the logical meaning of the ontology is owl:imports which lists other ontologies whose content is assumed to be part of the current document. Imported ontologies provide definitions that can be used, and owl:imports is a transitive property, meaning if one ontology imports another, it also imports any other ontologies that it depends on.
