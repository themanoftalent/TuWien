OWL Full is a comprehensive language in the OWL (Web Ontology Language) family that utilizes all the OWL language primitives and allows combining them with RDF and RDF Schema. It provides the flexibility to change the meaning of pre-defined primitives by applying them to each other. OWL Full is upward compatible with RDF and RDF Schema, meaning that any valid RDF/RDF Schema document is also a valid OWL Full document, and any conclusion made in RDF/RDF Schema is also valid in OWL Full.
