Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for finding the global minimum or maximum of a function.

In PSO, a swarm of particles move in the search space, each particle representing a candidate solution to the optimization problem. The velocity of each particle is updated based on its own best position found so far and the best position found so far by the swarm. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or reaching a desired level of precision.

The basic steps of PSO are:

Initialize the swarm of particles with random positions and velocities in the search space.

Evaluate the fitness of each particle at its current position.

Update the best position found so far for each particle.

Update the global best position found so far by the swarm.

Update the velocity of each particle based on its current velocity, the difference between its current position and its personal best position, and the difference between its current position and the global best position.

Update the position of each particle based on its velocity.

Repeat steps 2-6 until a stopping criterion is met.

Return the global best position found by the swarm as the optimized solution.

That's the simple and easy explanation of PSO algorithm.
